This is an update of gnuchess version 3.1.  It fixes all known bugs with 
pawn promotion, undo, and win/draw determination.  It adds the capability 
of reading xboard position files (xget).  It adds specification of save 
and load files on the command line (gnuchessr).  Save file format is now 
human readable.  'white' and 'black' no longer start play but only set the 
players. If the computer is to move first use the 'go' command.

New commands are xget and hashlevel.
	xget reads an xboard position file.
	hashlevel allows you to specify parameters for using the hashfile.

New Programs -
	postprint - allows printing of hashfile contents on a postscript printer
		for each position it prints tha board and the recommended move
		flags and depth.
		To run: just execute the program (pathname for hashfile is
			build in. Output comes out stdout. Then cat it with 
			ChessFonts and sent it to the printer. It prints 16
			positions per page.

			postprint >t
			cat ChessFonts t >p
			lpr p

	gnuan - a modified version of Truman Collins gnuan program with fixes
                for the gnuchess bugs. In addition it shows the best line for
                each move instead of just the next move. It will accept input
	        files produced by xboard (xboard.game.save) or from gnuchess
	        (chess.lst) files directly. 
		
		Output looks like this:

    Move White Black      Score Depth     Best Line
