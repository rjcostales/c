Thu May 24 13:42:24 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at baloo)
	* Fixed a bug reported by Brian Wong (wong@cs.UAlberta.CA) in
	ScoreKPK

Sat May  5 15:58:31 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at baloo)
	* extensive tests on MSDOS for 2 weeks and lots of changes:
	Moved all flags to a special flag structure.
	Added my own TODO file to the DOCUMENTATION.
	Moved GetOpenings and parse from the *dsp.c files.
	Made the transposition table enabled by default.
	Some cleanup in the *dsp.c code.
	Changed UpdateHashbd to a macro.

Wed Apr 18 16:38:30 1990  Hans-Erik Sandstr|m  (hes at tiamat)
	* Removed unnessesary global variables:
	(wking, bking, Enemyking, INCscore, slk, InChk, HasPawn,
	Zwmtl, Zbmtl, lpost, KBNKsq) this should make the program more
	readable.
	* Added a mini transposition table to detect repetitions, this
	means that repetition is called more seldom and should save some
	time. The idea for this came from Benno Tietz
	(tietz@eos.informatik.uni-bonn.de)

Thu Mar 29 02:49:00 1990  Thorsten Ohl at (td12@ddagsi3.bitnet)
     * nuxdsp.c has been given an ANSI interface (tailored
	after uxdsp.c as of Version 3.00 and a homegrown
	ANSI interface created in January for Version 1.55).
     *	uxdsp.c now understands ^C interrupts.
     *	both nuxdsp.c and uxdsp.c support the graphic characters
	of the IBM PC (can be disabled with -DSEVENBIT).
	It's of course a matter of taste, but I think it looks
	much better.
     * I have added prototypes and a makefile for a **IX compatible
	MS-DOS make (neither Turbo C or Microsoft C will understand
	this!).
     *	some formal parameters are not referenced. This is due to the
	different display interfaces and no problem at all. Just for
	aesthetic reasons I have shut up the compiler by incrementing
	the unreferenced variables.
     *	some longs are assigned to shorts and some shorts to unsigned chars.
	I have introduced a cast in each case, all are o.k. (as far
	as I can tell).

Thu Mar  8 09:11:28 1990  Hans-Erik Sandstr|m  (hes at orsa1)
	* The persistent hash table seems to work now. There are still some
	problems using it on a heterogenous network.

Sun Mar  4 14:44:44 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at orsa)
	* I am working on a persistent hash table. Currenly a 10Mb file
	with 262144 entrys. Stuart just asked me to spilt the posdata
	array to make gnuchess work better on a PC, so I did that.
	I have also tried to properly fix the bug that caused gnuchess
	to report mate prematurely. This, I hope, will also improve the
	search.

Tue Feb 27 18:27:23 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at davidson.log-sv.se)
	* used protoize to make a function prototyped version of gnuchess.
	this means that I have to use unprotoize before 'make distribution'
	to make a more portable K&R version.
	removed a ZeroTTable so now the hashtable is kept between moves.

Sat Feb 24 13:14:14 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at orsa)
	* Added a test to detect hash table collisions, define HASHTEST.
	I also removed 	the times calls since there is no sense in
	measuring cpu time when	wallclock time is all that counts when
	playing chess.

Fri Feb 23 17:25:37 1990  Hans Eric Sandstr|m  (hes at orsa)
	* Compiled gnuchess with gcc1.37 -Wall and got lots of
	implicit decaration warnings. Solved most of these by adding
	external declarations in gnuchess.h.

Wed Feb 21 17:41:28 1990 Jouko Holopainen (jhol@tolsun.oulu.fi) 
	* Contributed his code for ECO move entry (again!)
	and a file ansidsp.c (A msdos port of uxdsp.c).
	I(hes) started a merge of ansidsp.c and uxdsp.c.

February 8, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Changed the transpositon table to allow 65536 positions per player.
	This means a 1.3 Mbyte hash table. Introduced simple rehashing. And
	also made setting ttable 0 exclude all transposition code from
	gnuchess (for machines with very little memory).


February 3, 1990 -- Tom Vijlbrief (tnosoes!tom@nluug.n)
	Contributed code to fix undo of promotions.
	And a bugfix RMBLTY was to small.


Januari 27, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Fixed nuxdsp.c to work with my changes (Saved games format)


Januari 26, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Verified that the underpromotion routines works.
	Found and fixed the bug that caused gnuchess to report mate
	and draw prematurely.


Januari 25, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Received the underpromotion additions from jhol@tolsun.oulu.fi
	Made some optimizations in trapped and KingScan.
	Added more comments on how to improve the search.
	Added info on usage of the array Tree in post mode.
	Changed the index in the transposition table to unsigned short to
	allow a hash table of size 65536.


Januari 11, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Formatted gnuchess according to GNU standards with indent.


Januari 9, 1990 -- Hans Eric Sandstrom (hes@log-sv.se)
	Inserted a missing comma in KTHRT.
	Removed mvstr1[5],mvstr2[5] from gnuchess.c, they are only used in the
	user-interface routines uxdsp.c nondsp.c anyway.
	Rewrote algbr to generate move strings for underpromotion.
	(ph8k or h7h8k)
	Some optimizations in CaptureList.
	Changed row, column and locn to macros.
	Made memset default and introduced a switch NOMEMSET for
	computers without memset or where memset is a speed penality.
	I tested this on:
		Sparc		- no change
		DECstation	- no change
		Sun3/60		- 4% speed improvment.
	Changed + to | in some bit-field manipulations.
	Fixed the castle-with-moved-rook-bug, removed kingmoved and introduced
	an array Mvboard to keep track on how many times we have moved from a
	particular square.
	Fixed the check for zero division in Time controls.
	Added BINDIR and LIBDIR in the Makefile to set where gnuchess and
	gnuchess.book gets installed.
	All I have to do now is to test if all this works (-:
