18:001:001	There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
18:001:002	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
18:001:003	His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
18:001:004	And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
18:001:005	And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
18:001:006	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
18:001:007	And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
18:001:008	And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
18:001:009	Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
18:001:010	Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
18:001:011	But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
18:001:012	And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
18:001:013	And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
18:001:014	And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
18:001:015	And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
18:001:016	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
18:001:017	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
18:001:018	While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
18:001:019	And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
18:001:020	Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
18:001:021	And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
18:001:022	In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
18:002:001	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.
18:002:002	And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
18:002:003	And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
18:002:004	And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
18:002:005	But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
18:002:006	And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.
18:002:007	So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
18:002:008	And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
18:002:009	Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.
18:002:010	But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
18:002:011	Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
18:002:012	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
18:002:013	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
18:003:001	After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
18:003:002	And Job spake, and said,
18:003:003	Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
18:003:004	Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
18:003:005	Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
18:003:006	As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
18:003:007	Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
18:003:008	Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
18:003:009	Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
18:003:010	Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
18:003:011	Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
18:003:012	Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
18:003:013	For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
18:003:014	With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;
18:003:015	Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
18:003:016	Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
18:003:017	There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
18:003:018	There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
18:003:019	The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
18:003:020	Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
18:003:021	Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
18:003:022	Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
18:003:023	Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
18:003:024	For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
18:003:025	For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
18:003:026	I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
18:004:001	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
18:004:002	If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
18:004:003	Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
18:004:004	Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
18:004:005	But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
18:004:006	Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
18:004:007	Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
18:004:008	Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
18:004:009	By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
18:004:010	The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
18:004:011	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
18:004:012	Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
18:004:013	In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
18:004:014	Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
18:004:015	Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
18:004:016	It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
18:004:017	Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
18:004:018	Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
18:004:019	How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
18:004:020	They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
18:004:021	Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
18:005:001	Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
18:005:002	For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
18:005:003	I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
18:005:004	His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
18:005:005	Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
18:005:006	Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
18:005:007	Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
18:005:008	I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
18:005:009	Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
18:005:010	Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
18:005:011	To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
18:005:012	He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
18:005:013	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
18:005:014	They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
18:005:015	But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
18:005:016	So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
18:005:017	Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
18:005:018	For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
18:005:019	He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
18:005:020	In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
18:005:021	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
18:005:022	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
18:005:023	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
18:005:024	And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
18:005:025	Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
18:005:026	Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
18:005:027	Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
18:006:001	But Job answered and said,
18:006:002	Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
18:006:003	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
18:006:004	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
18:006:005	Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
18:006:006	Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
18:006:007	The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
18:006:008	Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
18:006:009	Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
18:006:010	Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
18:006:011	What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
18:006:012	Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
18:006:013	Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
18:006:014	To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
18:006:015	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
18:006:016	Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:
18:006:017	What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
18:006:018	The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
18:006:019	The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
18:006:020	They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
18:006:021	For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
18:006:022	Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
18:006:023	Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
18:006:024	Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
18:006:025	How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
18:006:026	Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
18:006:027	Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.
18:006:028	Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.
18:006:029	Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.
18:006:030	Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
18:007:001	Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?
18:007:002	As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:
18:007:003	So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
18:007:004	When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
18:007:005	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
18:007:006	My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
18:007:007	O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
18:007:008	The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
18:007:009	As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
18:007:010	He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
18:007:011	Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18:007:012	Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
18:007:013	When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;
18:007:014	Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
18:007:015	So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
18:007:016	I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
18:007:017	What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
18:007:018	And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
18:007:019	How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
18:007:020	I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
18:007:021	And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
18:008:001	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
18:008:002	How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
18:008:003	Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
18:008:004	If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
18:008:005	If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
18:008:006	If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
18:008:007	Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
18:008:008	For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
18:008:009	(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
18:008:010	Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
18:008:011	Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
18:008:012	Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.
18:008:013	So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
18:008:014	Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.
18:008:015	He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
18:008:016	He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
18:008:017	His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
18:008:018	If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
18:008:019	Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
18:008:020	Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:
18:008:021	Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
18:008:022	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
18:009:001	Then Job answered and said,
18:009:002	I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
18:009:003	If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
18:009:004	He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
18:009:005	Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
18:009:006	Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
18:009:007	Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
18:009:008	Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
18:009:009	Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
18:009:010	Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.
18:009:011	Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
18:009:012	Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?
18:009:013	If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
18:009:014	How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?
18:009:015	Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
18:009:016	If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
18:009:017	For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
18:009:018	He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
18:009:019	If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
18:009:020	If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
18:009:021	Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.
18:009:022	This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
18:009:023	If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
18:009:024	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?
18:009:025	Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
18:009:026	They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.
18:009:027	If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:
18:009:028	I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
18:009:029	If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?
18:009:030	If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
18:009:031	Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
18:009:032	For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.
18:009:033	Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.
18:009:034	Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
18:009:035	Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
18:010:001	My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
18:010:002	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
18:010:003	Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
18:010:004	Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
18:010:005	Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,
18:010:006	That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
18:010:007	Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.
18:010:008	Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
18:010:009	Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
18:010:010	Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
18:010:011	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
18:010:012	Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
18:010:013	And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.
18:010:014	If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
18:010:015	If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;
18:010:016	For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
18:010:017	Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
18:010:018	Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
18:010:019	I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
18:010:020	Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
18:010:021	Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
18:010:022	A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
18:011:001	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
18:011:002	Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
18:011:003	Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
18:011:004	For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.
18:011:005	But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
18:011:006	And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
18:011:007	Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
18:011:008	It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
18:011:009	The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
18:011:010	If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
18:011:011	For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
18:011:012	For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.
18:011:013	If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;
18:011:014	If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
18:011:015	For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
18:011:016	Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:
18:011:017	And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
18:011:018	And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
18:011:019	Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
18:011:020	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
18:012:001	And Job answered and said,
18:012:002	No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
18:012:003	But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
18:012:004	I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.
18:012:005	He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
18:012:006	The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
18:012:007	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
18:012:008	Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
18:012:009	Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
18:012:010	In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
18:012:011	Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
18:012:012	With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
18:012:013	With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
18:012:014	Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
18:012:015	Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
18:012:016	With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
18:012:017	He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
18:012:018	He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
18:012:019	He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
18:012:020	He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
18:012:021	He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
18:012:022	He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
18:012:023	He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.
18:012:024	He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
18:012:025	They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
18:013:001	Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.
18:013:002	What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.
18:013:003	Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
18:013:004	But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
18:013:005	O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
18:013:006	Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
18:013:007	Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
18:013:008	Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
18:013:009	Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?
18:013:010	He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
18:013:011	Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
18:013:012	Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
18:013:013	Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
18:013:014	Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
18:013:015	Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
18:013:016	He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
18:013:017	Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
18:013:018	Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.
18:013:019	Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
18:013:020	Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
18:013:021	Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
18:013:022	Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
18:013:023	How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
18:013:024	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
18:013:025	Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
18:013:026	For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
18:013:027	Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
18:013:028	And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
18:014:001	Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.
18:014:002	He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
18:014:003	And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?
18:014:004	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
18:014:005	Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
18:014:006	Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.
18:014:007	For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
18:014:008	Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;
18:014:009	Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.
18:014:010	But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
18:014:011	As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
18:014:012	So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
18:014:013	O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
18:014:014	If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
18:014:015	Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
18:014:016	For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
18:014:017	My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.
18:014:018	And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.
18:014:019	The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
18:014:020	Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
18:014:021	His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
18:014:022	But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
18:015:001	Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
18:015:002	Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
18:015:003	Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
18:015:004	Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
18:015:005	For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
18:015:006	Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
18:015:007	Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
18:015:008	Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
18:015:009	What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?
18:015:010	With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.
18:015:011	Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
18:015:012	Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
18:015:013	That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?
18:015:014	What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
18:015:015	Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
18:015:016	How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?
18:015:017	I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;
18:015:018	Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:
18:015:019	Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
18:015:020	The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
18:015:021	A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
18:015:022	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
18:015:023	He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
18:015:024	Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
18:015:025	For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
18:015:026	He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
18:015:027	Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.
18:015:028	And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
18:015:029	He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
18:015:030	He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
18:015:031	Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
18:015:032	It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
18:015:033	He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
18:015:034	For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
18:015:035	They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
18:016:001	Then Job answered and said,
18:016:002	I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
18:016:003	Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
18:016:004	I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.
18:016:005	But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.
18:016:006	Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
18:016:007	But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
18:016:008	And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
18:016:009	He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
18:016:010	They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
18:016:011	God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
18:016:012	I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
18:016:013	His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
18:016:014	He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
18:016:015	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
18:016:016	My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
18:016:017	Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.
18:016:018	O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
18:016:019	Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
18:016:020	My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
18:016:021	O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!
18:016:022	When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
18:017:001	My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
18:017:002	Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
18:017:003	Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
18:017:004	For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
18:017:005	He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
18:017:006	He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
18:017:007	Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.
18:017:008	Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
18:017:009	The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
18:017:010	But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.
18:017:011	My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.
18:017:012	They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
18:017:013	If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.
18:017:014	I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.
18:017:015	And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
18:017:016	They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
18:018:001	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
18:018:002	How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
18:018:003	Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?
18:018:004	He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
18:018:005	Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
18:018:006	The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
18:018:007	The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
18:018:008	For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.
18:018:009	The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.
18:018:010	The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
18:018:011	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
18:018:012	His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.
18:018:013	It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
18:018:014	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
18:018:015	It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
18:018:016	His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
18:018:017	His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
18:018:018	He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
18:018:019	He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
18:018:020	They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
18:018:021	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
18:019:001	Then Job answered and said,
18:019:002	How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
18:019:003	These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
18:019:004	And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.
18:019:005	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:
18:019:006	Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.
18:019:007	Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
18:019:008	He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
18:019:009	He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
18:019:010	He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
18:019:011	He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.
18:019:012	His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.
18:019:013	He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
18:019:014	My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
18:019:015	They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
18:019:016	I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.
18:019:017	My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.
18:019:018	Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
18:019:019	All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
18:019:020	My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
18:019:021	Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
18:019:022	Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
18:019:023	Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
18:019:024	That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
18:019:025	For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
18:019:026	And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
18:019:027	Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
18:019:028	But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
18:019:029	Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
18:020:001	Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
18:020:002	Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.
18:020:003	I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
18:020:004	Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
18:020:005	That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
18:020:006	Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
18:020:007	Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
18:020:008	He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
18:020:009	The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
18:020:010	His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
18:020:011	His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
18:020:012	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;
18:020:013	Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
18:020:014	Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.
18:020:015	He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
18:020:016	He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
18:020:017	He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
18:020:018	That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.
18:020:019	Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
18:020:020	Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
18:020:021	There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
18:020:022	In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
18:020:023	When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
18:020:024	He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.
18:020:025	It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.
18:020:026	All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
18:020:027	The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
18:020:028	The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
18:020:029	This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
18:021:001	But Job answered and said,
18:021:002	Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
18:021:003	Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
18:021:004	As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
18:021:005	Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
18:021:006	Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
18:021:007	Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?
18:021:008	Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
18:021:009	Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.
18:021:010	Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
18:021:011	They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
18:021:012	They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
18:021:013	They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
18:021:014	Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
18:021:015	What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
18:021:016	Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
18:021:017	How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
18:021:018	They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
18:021:019	God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
18:021:020	His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
18:021:021	For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
18:021:022	Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
18:021:023	One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
18:021:024	His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
18:021:025	And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
18:021:026	They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
18:021:027	Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
18:021:028	For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
18:021:029	Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
18:021:030	That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
18:021:031	Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
18:021:032	Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
18:021:033	The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
18:021:034	How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
18:022:001	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
18:022:002	Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
18:022:003	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
18:022:004	Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
18:022:005	Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?
18:022:006	For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
18:022:007	Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
18:022:008	But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.
18:022:009	Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
18:022:010	Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
18:022:011	Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
18:022:012	Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
18:022:013	And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?
18:022:014	Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
18:022:015	Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
18:022:016	Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
18:022:017	Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
18:022:018	Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
18:022:019	The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
18:022:020	Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
18:022:021	Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.
18:022:022	Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.
18:022:023	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
18:022:024	Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
18:022:025	Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
18:022:026	For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
18:022:027	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
18:022:028	Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
18:022:029	When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.
18:022:030	He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
18:023:001	Then Job answered and said,
18:023:002	Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
18:023:003	Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!
18:023:004	I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
18:023:005	I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
18:023:006	Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
18:023:007	There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
18:023:008	Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
18:023:009	On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
18:023:010	But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
18:023:011	My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
18:023:012	Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
18:023:013	But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
18:023:014	For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
18:023:015	Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
18:023:016	For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
18:023:017	Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
18:024:001	Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
18:024:002	Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
18:024:003	They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
18:024:004	They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
18:024:005	Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.
18:024:006	They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
18:024:007	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.
18:024:008	They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
18:024:009	They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
18:024:010	They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;
18:024:011	Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
18:024:012	Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
18:024:013	They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
18:024:014	The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
18:024:015	The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.
18:024:016	In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.
18:024:017	For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.
18:024:018	He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
18:024:019	Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.
18:024:020	The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
18:024:021	He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
18:024:022	He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.
18:024:023	Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.
18:024:024	They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
18:024:025	And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
18:025:001	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
18:025:002	Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.
18:025:003	Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
18:025:004	How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
18:025:005	Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.
18:025:006	How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?
18:026:001	But Job answered and said,
18:026:002	How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
18:026:003	How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
18:026:004	To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
18:026:005	Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
18:026:006	Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
18:026:007	He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
18:026:008	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
18:026:009	He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
18:026:010	He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
18:026:011	The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
18:026:012	He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
18:026:013	By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
18:026:014	Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
18:027:001	Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
18:027:002	As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
18:027:003	All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
18:027:004	My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
18:027:005	God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
18:027:006	My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
18:027:007	Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
18:027:008	For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
18:027:009	Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
18:027:010	Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
18:027:011	I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
18:027:012	Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
18:027:013	This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
18:027:014	If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
18:027:015	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
18:027:016	Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
18:027:017	He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
18:027:018	He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
18:027:019	The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.
18:027:020	Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
18:027:021	The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
18:027:022	For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
18:027:023	Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
18:028:001	Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.
18:028:002	Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.
18:028:003	He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
18:028:004	The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
18:028:005	As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
18:028:006	The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
18:028:007	There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
18:028:008	The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
18:028:009	He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
18:028:010	He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
18:028:011	He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
18:028:012	But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
18:028:013	Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
18:028:014	The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
18:028:015	It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
18:028:016	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
18:028:017	The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
18:028:018	No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.
18:028:019	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
18:028:020	Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
18:028:021	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
18:028:022	Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
18:028:023	God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
18:028:024	For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;
18:028:025	To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
18:028:026	When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
18:028:027	Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
18:028:028	And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
18:029:001	Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,
18:029:002	Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
18:029:003	When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;
18:029:004	As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
18:029:005	When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
18:029:006	When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
18:029:007	When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
18:029:008	The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.
18:029:009	The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
18:029:010	The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
18:029:011	When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
18:029:012	Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
18:029:013	The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
18:029:014	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
18:029:015	I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
18:029:016	I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
18:029:017	And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
18:029:018	Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
18:029:019	My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
18:029:020	My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
18:029:021	Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
18:029:022	After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
18:029:023	And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
18:029:024	If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
18:029:025	I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
18:030:001	But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
18:030:002	Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?
18:030:003	For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
18:030:004	Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.
18:030:005	They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)
18:030:006	To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
18:030:007	Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
18:030:008	They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
18:030:009	And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
18:030:010	They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
18:030:011	Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
18:030:012	Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
18:030:013	They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
18:030:014	They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.
18:030:015	Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
18:030:016	And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
18:030:017	My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
18:030:018	By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
18:030:019	He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
18:030:020	I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
18:030:021	Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
18:030:022	Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.
18:030:023	For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
18:030:024	Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
18:030:025	Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?
18:030:026	When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
18:030:027	My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
18:030:028	I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
18:030:029	I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
18:030:030	My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
18:030:031	My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
18:031:001	I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
18:031:002	For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
18:031:003	Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
18:031:004	Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
18:031:005	If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
18:031:006	Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.
18:031:007	If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
18:031:008	Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
18:031:009	If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
18:031:010	Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
18:031:011	For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
18:031:012	For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
18:031:013	If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
18:031:014	What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
18:031:015	Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
18:031:016	If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
18:031:017	Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
18:031:018	(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
18:031:019	If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
18:031:020	If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
18:031:021	If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
18:031:022	Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
18:031:023	For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
18:031:024	If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
18:031:025	If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
18:031:026	If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
18:031:027	And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
18:031:028	This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
18:031:029	If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
18:031:030	Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
18:031:031	If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
18:031:032	The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.
18:031:033	If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
18:031:034	Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
18:031:035	Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
18:031:036	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
18:031:037	I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
18:031:038	If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
18:031:039	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
18:031:040	Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
18:032:001	So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
18:032:002	Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
18:032:003	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
18:032:004	Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
18:032:005	When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
18:032:006	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
18:032:007	I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
18:032:008	But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
18:032:009	Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
18:032:010	Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
18:032:011	Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
18:032:012	Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
18:032:013	Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
18:032:014	Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
18:032:015	They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
18:032:016	When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
18:032:017	I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
18:032:018	For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
18:032:019	Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
18:032:020	I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
18:032:021	Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
18:032:022	For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
18:033:001	Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
18:033:002	Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
18:033:003	My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
18:033:004	The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
18:033:005	If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
18:033:006	Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
18:033:007	Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
18:033:008	Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
18:033:009	I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
18:033:010	Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
18:033:011	He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
18:033:012	Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
18:033:013	Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
18:033:014	For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
18:033:015	In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
18:033:016	Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
18:033:017	That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
18:033:018	He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
18:033:019	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
18:033:020	So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
18:033:021	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
18:033:022	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
18:033:023	If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
18:033:024	Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
18:033:025	His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
18:033:026	He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
18:033:027	He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
18:033:028	He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
18:033:029	Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
18:033:030	To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
18:033:031	Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
18:033:032	If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
18:033:033	If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
18:034:001	Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
18:034:002	Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
18:034:003	For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
18:034:004	Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
18:034:005	For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
18:034:006	Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
18:034:007	What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
18:034:008	Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
18:034:009	For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
18:034:010	Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
18:034:011	For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
18:034:012	Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
18:034:013	Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
18:034:014	If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
18:034:015	All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
18:034:016	If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
18:034:017	Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
18:034:018	Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
18:034:019	How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
18:034:020	In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
18:034:021	For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
18:034:022	There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
18:034:023	For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
18:034:024	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
18:034:025	Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
18:034:026	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
18:034:027	Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
18:034:028	So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
18:034:029	When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
18:034:030	That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
18:034:031	Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
18:034:032	That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
18:034:033	Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
18:034:034	Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
18:034:035	Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
18:034:036	My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
18:034:037	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
18:035:001	Elihu spake moreover, and said,
18:035:002	Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
18:035:003	For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
18:035:004	I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
18:035:005	Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
18:035:006	If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
18:035:007	If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
18:035:008	Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
18:035:009	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
18:035:010	But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
18:035:011	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
18:035:012	There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
18:035:013	Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
18:035:014	Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
18:035:015	But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:
18:035:016	Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
18:036:001	Elihu also proceeded, and said,
18:036:002	Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
18:036:003	I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
18:036:004	For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
18:036:005	Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
18:036:006	He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
18:036:007	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
18:036:008	And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
18:036:009	Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
18:036:010	He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
18:036:011	If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
18:036:012	But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
18:036:013	But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
18:036:014	They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
18:036:015	He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
18:036:016	Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
18:036:017	But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
18:036:018	Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
18:036:019	Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
18:036:020	Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
18:036:021	Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
18:036:022	Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
18:036:023	Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
18:036:024	Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
18:036:025	Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
18:036:026	Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
18:036:027	For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
18:036:028	Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
18:036:029	Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
18:036:030	Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
18:036:031	For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
18:036:032	With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
18:036:033	The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
18:037:001	At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
18:037:002	Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
18:037:003	He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
18:037:004	After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
18:037:005	God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
18:037:006	For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
18:037:007	He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
18:037:008	Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
18:037:009	Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
18:037:010	By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
18:037:011	Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
18:037:012	And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.
18:037:013	He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
18:037:014	Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
18:037:015	Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
18:037:016	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
18:037:017	How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
18:037:018	Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?
18:037:019	Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
18:037:020	Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
18:037:021	And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
18:037:022	Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.
18:037:023	Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
18:037:024	Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
18:038:001	Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
18:038:002	Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
18:038:003	Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
18:038:004	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
18:038:005	Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
18:038:006	Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
18:038:007	When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
18:038:008	Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
18:038:009	When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
18:038:010	And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
18:038:011	And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
18:038:012	Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;
18:038:013	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
18:038:014	It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
18:038:015	And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.
18:038:016	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
18:038:017	Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
18:038:018	Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
18:038:019	Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
18:038:020	That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
18:038:021	Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?
18:038:022	Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
18:038:023	Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
18:038:024	By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
18:038:025	Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
18:038:026	To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
18:038:027	To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
18:038:028	Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
18:038:029	Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
18:038:030	The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
18:038:031	Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
18:038:032	Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
18:038:033	Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
18:038:034	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
18:038:035	Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?
18:038:036	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
18:038:037	Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
18:038:038	When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
18:038:039	Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
18:038:040	When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
18:038:041	Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
18:039:001	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
18:039:002	Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
18:039:003	They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
18:039:004	Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.
18:039:005	Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
18:039:006	Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
18:039:007	He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
18:039:008	The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
18:039:009	Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
18:039:010	Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
18:039:011	Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
18:039:012	Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?
18:039:013	Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
18:039:014	Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,
18:039:015	And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
18:039:016	She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;
18:039:017	Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
18:039:018	What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
18:039:019	Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
18:039:020	Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
18:039:021	He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
18:039:022	He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
18:039:023	The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
18:039:024	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
18:039:025	He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
18:039:026	Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?
18:039:027	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
18:039:028	She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
18:039:029	From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
18:039:030	Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
18:040:001	Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,
18:040:002	Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
18:040:003	Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
18:040:004	Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
18:040:005	Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
18:040:006	Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
18:040:007	Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
18:040:008	Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
18:040:009	Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
18:040:010	Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
18:040:011	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
18:040:012	Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
18:040:013	Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
18:040:014	Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
18:040:015	Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
18:040:016	Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
18:040:017	He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
18:040:018	His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
18:040:019	He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
18:040:020	Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
18:040:021	He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
18:040:022	The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
18:040:023	Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
18:040:024	He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
18:041:001	Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
18:041:002	Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
18:041:003	Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?
18:041:004	Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
18:041:005	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
18:041:006	Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
18:041:007	Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
18:041:008	Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
18:041:009	Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
18:041:010	None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
18:041:011	Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
18:041:012	I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
18:041:013	Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?
18:041:014	Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
18:041:015	His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
18:041:016	One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
18:041:017	They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
18:041:018	By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
18:041:019	Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
18:041:020	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
18:041:021	His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
18:041:022	In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
18:041:023	The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
18:041:024	His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
18:041:025	When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
18:041:026	The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
18:041:027	He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
18:041:028	The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
18:041:029	Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
18:041:030	Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
18:041:031	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
18:041:032	He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
18:041:033	Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
18:041:034	He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
18:042:001	Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
18:042:002	I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
18:042:003	Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
18:042:004	Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
18:042:005	I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.
18:042:006	Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
18:042:007	And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
18:042:008	Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
18:042:009	So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
18:042:010	And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
18:042:011	Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
18:042:012	So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
18:042:013	He had also seven sons and three daughters.
18:042:014	And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
18:042:015	And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
18:042:016	After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
18:042:017	So Job died, being old and full of days.
