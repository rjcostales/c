19:001:001	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
19:001:002	But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
19:001:003	And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
19:001:004	The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
19:001:005	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
19:001:006	For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
19:002:001	Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
19:002:002	The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,
19:002:003	Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
19:002:004	He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.
19:002:005	Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
19:002:006	Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
19:002:007	I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
19:002:008	Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
19:002:009	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
19:002:010	Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
19:002:011	Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
19:002:012	Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
19:003:001	Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.
19:003:002	Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
19:003:003	But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
19:003:004	I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
19:003:005	I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
19:003:006	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.
19:003:007	Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
19:003:008	Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
19:004:001	Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
19:004:002	O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
19:004:003	But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
19:004:004	Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
19:004:005	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.
19:004:006	There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
19:004:007	Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.
19:004:008	I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
19:005:001	Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
19:005:002	Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
19:005:003	My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
19:005:004	For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
19:005:005	The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
19:005:006	Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
19:005:007	But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
19:005:008	Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
19:005:009	For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
19:005:010	Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
19:005:011	But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
19:005:012	For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
19:006:001	O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
19:006:002	Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
19:006:003	My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
19:006:004	Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
19:006:005	For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
19:006:006	I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
19:006:007	Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
19:006:008	Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
19:006:009	The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
19:006:010	Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
19:007:001	O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
19:007:002	Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
19:007:003	O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
19:007:004	If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
19:007:005	Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
19:007:006	Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
19:007:007	So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
19:007:008	The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
19:007:009	Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
19:007:010	My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
19:007:011	God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
19:007:012	If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
19:007:013	He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
19:007:014	Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
19:007:015	He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
19:007:016	His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
19:007:017	I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
19:008:001	O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
19:008:002	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
19:008:003	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
19:008:004	What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
19:008:005	For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
19:008:006	Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
19:008:007	All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
19:008:008	The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
19:008:009	O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
19:009:001	I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
19:009:002	I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
19:009:003	When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
19:009:004	For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
19:009:005	Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
19:009:006	O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
19:009:007	But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
19:009:008	And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
19:009:009	The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
19:009:010	And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
19:009:011	Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
19:009:012	When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
19:009:013	Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
19:009:014	That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
19:009:015	The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
19:009:016	The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
19:009:017	The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
19:009:018	For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.
19:009:019	Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
19:009:020	Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.
19:010:001	Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
19:010:002	The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
19:010:003	For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
19:010:004	The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
19:010:005	His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
19:010:006	He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.
19:010:007	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
19:010:008	He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
19:010:009	He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
19:010:010	He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
19:010:011	He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.
19:010:012	Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
19:010:013	Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
19:010:014	Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
19:010:015	Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
19:010:016	The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.
19:010:017	LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
19:010:018	To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
19:011:001	In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?
19:011:002	For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
19:011:003	If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
19:011:004	The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
19:011:005	The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
19:011:006	Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
19:011:007	For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
19:012:001	Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
19:012:002	They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
19:012:003	The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:
19:012:004	Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
19:012:005	For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
19:012:006	The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
19:012:007	Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
19:012:008	The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
19:013:001	How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
19:013:002	How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
19:013:003	Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
19:013:004	Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
19:013:005	But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
19:013:006	I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
19:014:001	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
19:014:002	The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.
19:014:003	They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
19:014:004	Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
19:014:005	There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.
19:014:006	Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.
19:014:007	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
19:015:001	Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
19:015:002	He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.
19:015:003	He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
19:015:004	In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.
19:015:005	He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
19:016:001	Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
19:016:002	O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;
19:016:003	But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
19:016:004	Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
19:016:005	The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
19:016:006	The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
19:016:007	I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
19:016:008	I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
19:016:009	Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
19:016:010	For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
19:016:011	Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
19:017:001	Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
19:017:002	Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.
19:017:003	Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
19:017:004	Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
19:017:005	Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
19:017:006	I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
19:017:007	Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.
19:017:008	Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
19:017:009	From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.
19:017:010	They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.
19:017:011	They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;
19:017:012	Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
19:017:013	Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:
19:017:014	From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
19:017:015	As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
19:018:001	I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
19:018:002	The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
19:018:003	I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
19:018:004	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
19:018:005	The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
19:018:006	In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.
19:018:007	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
19:018:008	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
19:018:009	He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
19:018:010	And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
19:018:011	He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
19:018:012	At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
19:018:013	The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.
19:018:014	Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
19:018:015	Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
19:018:016	He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
19:018:017	He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
19:018:018	They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
19:018:019	He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
19:018:020	The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
19:018:021	For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
19:018:022	For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
19:018:023	I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
19:018:024	Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
19:018:025	With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
19:018:026	With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
19:018:027	For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
19:018:028	For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
19:018:029	For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
19:018:030	As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
19:018:031	For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?
19:018:032	It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
19:018:033	He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.
19:018:034	He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
19:018:035	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
19:018:036	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
19:018:037	I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
19:018:038	I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
19:018:039	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
19:018:040	Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
19:018:041	They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
19:018:042	Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
19:018:043	Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
19:018:044	As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
19:018:045	The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
19:018:046	The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
19:018:047	It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
19:018:048	He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
19:018:049	Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
19:018:050	Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
19:019:001	The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
19:019:002	Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
19:019:003	There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
19:019:004	Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
19:019:005	Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
19:019:006	His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
19:019:007	The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
19:019:008	The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
19:019:009	The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
19:019:010	More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
19:019:011	Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.
19:019:012	Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.
19:019:013	Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
19:019:014	Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
19:020:001	The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
19:020:002	Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
19:020:003	Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
19:020:004	Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
19:020:005	We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
19:020:006	Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
19:020:007	Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.
19:020:008	They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
19:020:009	Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
19:021:001	The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
19:021:002	Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
19:021:003	For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
19:021:004	He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.
19:021:005	His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
19:021:006	For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
19:021:007	For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
19:021:008	Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
19:021:009	Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
19:021:010	Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
19:021:011	For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.
19:021:012	Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
19:021:013	Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.
19:022:001	My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
19:022:002	O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
19:022:003	But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
19:022:004	Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
19:022:005	They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
19:022:006	But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
19:022:007	All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
19:022:008	He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
19:022:009	But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.
19:022:010	I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.
19:022:011	Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.
19:022:012	Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
19:022:013	They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.
19:022:014	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
19:022:015	My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
19:022:016	For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
19:022:017	I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
19:022:018	They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
19:022:019	But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
19:022:020	Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
19:022:021	Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
19:022:022	I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
19:022:023	Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
19:022:024	For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
19:022:025	My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
19:022:026	The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.
19:022:027	All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
19:022:028	For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.
19:022:029	All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.
19:022:030	A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
19:022:031	They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.
19:023:001	The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
19:023:002	He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
19:023:003	He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
19:023:004	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
19:023:005	Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
19:023:006	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
19:024:001	The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
19:024:002	For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
19:024:003	Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?
19:024:004	He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
19:024:005	He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
19:024:006	This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
19:024:007	Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
19:024:008	Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.
19:024:009	Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
19:024:010	Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.
19:025:001	Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
19:025:002	O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
19:025:003	Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
19:025:004	Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
19:025:005	Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
19:025:006	Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.
19:025:007	Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
19:025:008	Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
19:025:009	The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
19:025:010	All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
19:025:011	For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.
19:025:012	What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.
19:025:013	His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
19:025:014	The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.
19:025:015	Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
19:025:016	Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.
19:025:017	The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.
19:025:018	Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
19:025:019	Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
19:025:020	O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
19:025:021	Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
19:025:022	Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
19:026:001	Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.
19:026:002	Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
19:026:003	For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
19:026:004	I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
19:026:005	I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
19:026:006	I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:
19:026:007	That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
19:026:008	LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
19:026:009	Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
19:026:010	In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
19:026:011	But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
19:026:012	My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
19:027:001	The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
19:027:002	When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
19:027:003	Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
19:027:004	One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.
19:027:005	For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.
19:027:006	And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.
19:027:007	Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
19:027:008	When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.
19:027:009	Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
19:027:010	When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.
19:027:011	Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.
19:027:012	Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
19:027:013	I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
19:027:014	Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
19:028:001	Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
19:028:002	Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
19:028:003	Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.
19:028:004	Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.
19:028:005	Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
19:028:006	Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
19:028:007	The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
19:028:008	The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.
19:028:009	Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
19:029:001	Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
19:029:002	Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
19:029:003	The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.
19:029:004	The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.
19:029:005	The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.
19:029:006	He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.
19:029:007	The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
19:029:008	The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.
19:029:009	The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.
19:029:010	The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.
19:029:011	The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
19:030:001	I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
19:030:002	O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
19:030:003	O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
19:030:004	Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
19:030:005	For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
19:030:006	And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
19:030:007	LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.
19:030:008	I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
19:030:009	What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
19:030:010	Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
19:030:011	Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
19:030:012	To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
19:031:001	In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.
19:031:002	Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
19:031:003	For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
19:031:004	Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.
19:031:005	Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.
19:031:006	I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.
19:031:007	I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
19:031:008	And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.
19:031:009	Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.
19:031:010	For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
19:031:011	I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.
19:031:012	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.
19:031:013	For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.
19:031:014	But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.
19:031:015	My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
19:031:016	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.
19:031:017	Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.
19:031:018	Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
19:031:019	Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!
19:031:020	Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
19:031:021	Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.
19:031:022	For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
19:031:023	O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
19:031:024	Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
19:032:001	Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
19:032:002	Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
19:032:003	When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
19:032:004	For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
19:032:005	I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
19:032:006	For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
19:032:007	Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
19:032:008	I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
19:032:009	Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
19:032:010	Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.
19:032:011	Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
19:033:001	Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.
19:033:002	Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.
19:033:003	Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
19:033:004	For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.
19:033:005	He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
19:033:006	By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
19:033:007	He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
19:033:008	Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
19:033:009	For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
19:033:010	The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
19:033:011	The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
19:033:012	Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
19:033:013	The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
19:033:014	From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
19:033:015	He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
19:033:016	There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
19:033:017	An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
19:033:018	Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;
19:033:019	To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
19:033:020	Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
19:033:021	For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
19:033:022	Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
19:034:001	I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
19:034:002	My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.
19:034:003	O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
19:034:004	I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.
19:034:005	They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.
19:034:006	This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.
19:034:007	The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.
19:034:008	O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
19:034:009	O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.
19:034:010	The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.
19:034:011	Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
19:034:012	What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
19:034:013	Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
19:034:014	Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
19:034:015	The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.
19:034:016	The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
19:034:017	The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.
19:034:018	The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
19:034:019	Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.
19:034:020	He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
19:034:021	Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.
19:034:022	The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
19:035:001	Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.
19:035:002	Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
19:035:003	Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
19:035:004	Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
19:035:005	Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.
19:035:006	Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.
19:035:007	For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.
19:035:008	Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.
19:035:009	And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.
19:035:010	All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
19:035:011	False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
19:035:012	They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.
19:035:013	But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
19:035:014	I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.
19:035:015	But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:
19:035:016	With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
19:035:017	Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.
19:035:018	I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.
19:035:019	Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
19:035:020	For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.
19:035:021	Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
19:035:022	This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.
19:035:023	Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
19:035:024	Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
19:035:025	Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
19:035:026	Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.
19:035:027	Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
19:035:028	And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.
19:036:001	The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.
19:036:002	For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
19:036:003	The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.
19:036:004	He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.
19:036:005	Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.
19:036:006	Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.
19:036:007	How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
19:036:008	They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
19:036:009	For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.
19:036:010	O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
19:036:011	Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
19:036:012	There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
19:037:001	Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
19:037:002	For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
19:037:003	Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
19:037:004	Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
19:037:005	Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
19:037:006	And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
19:037:007	Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
19:037:008	Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
19:037:009	For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
19:037:010	For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
19:037:011	But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
19:037:012	The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
19:037:013	The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
19:037:014	The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.
19:037:015	Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
19:037:016	A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.
19:037:017	For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
19:037:018	The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
19:037:019	They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
19:037:020	But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
19:037:021	The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
19:037:022	For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.
19:037:023	The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.
19:037:024	Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.
19:037:025	I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
19:037:026	He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
19:037:027	Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
19:037:028	For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
19:037:029	The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
19:037:030	The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
19:037:031	The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
19:037:032	The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
19:037:033	The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
19:037:034	Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
19:037:035	I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
19:037:036	Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
19:037:037	Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.
19:037:038	But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
19:037:039	But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.
19:037:040	And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
19:038:001	O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
19:038:002	For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
19:038:003	There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
19:038:004	For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
19:038:005	My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
19:038:006	I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
19:038:007	For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.
19:038:008	I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
19:038:009	Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
19:038:010	My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
19:038:011	My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
19:038:012	They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
19:038:013	But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
19:038:014	Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
19:038:015	For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
19:038:016	For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
19:038:017	For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
19:038:018	For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
19:038:019	But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
19:038:020	They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.
19:038:021	Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
19:038:022	Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
19:039:001	I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
19:039:002	I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
19:039:003	My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,
19:039:004	LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.
19:039:005	Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.
19:039:006	Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
19:039:007	And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
19:039:008	Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.
19:039:009	I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
19:039:010	Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
19:039:011	When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.
19:039:012	Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
19:039:013	O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
19:040:001	I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
19:040:002	He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
19:040:003	And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
19:040:004	Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
19:040:005	Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
19:040:006	Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
19:040:007	Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
19:040:008	I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.
19:040:009	I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
19:040:010	I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
19:040:011	Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
19:040:012	For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
19:040:013	Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
19:040:014	Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
19:040:015	Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
19:040:016	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
19:040:017	But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
19:041:001	Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.
19:041:002	The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
19:041:003	The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
19:041:004	I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
19:041:005	Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
19:041:006	And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
19:041:007	All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.
19:041:008	An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
19:041:009	Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
19:041:010	But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
19:041:011	By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
19:041:012	And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.
19:041:013	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
19:042:001	As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
19:042:002	My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?
19:042:003	My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
19:042:004	When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.
19:042:005	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.
19:042:006	O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.
19:042:007	Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
19:042:008	Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.
19:042:009	I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
19:042:010	As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?
19:042:011	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
19:043:001	Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
19:043:002	For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
19:043:003	O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
19:043:004	Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
19:043:005	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
19:044:001	We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
19:044:002	How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
19:044:003	For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
19:044:004	Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
19:044:005	Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
19:044:006	For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
19:044:007	But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
19:044:008	In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
19:044:009	But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
19:044:010	Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
19:044:011	Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
19:044:012	Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.
19:044:013	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
19:044:014	Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
19:044:015	My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
19:044:016	For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
19:044:017	All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
19:044:018	Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
19:044:019	Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
19:044:020	If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
19:044:021	Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
19:044:022	Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
19:044:023	Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.
19:044:024	Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
19:044:025	For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
19:044:026	Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
19:045:001	My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
19:045:002	Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
19:045:003	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
19:045:004	And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
19:045:005	Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.
19:045:006	Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
19:045:007	Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
19:045:008	All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
19:045:009	Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
19:045:010	Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
19:045:011	So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
19:045:012	And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
19:045:013	The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
19:045:014	She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
19:045:015	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.
19:045:016	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
19:045:017	I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
19:046:001	God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
19:046:002	Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
19:046:003	Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
19:046:004	There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.
19:046:005	God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.
19:046:006	The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
19:046:007	The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
19:046:008	Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
19:046:009	He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
19:046:010	Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
19:046:011	The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
19:047:001	O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
19:047:002	For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.
19:047:003	He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.
19:047:004	He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
19:047:005	God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.
19:047:006	Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
19:047:007	For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.
19:047:008	God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.
19:047:009	The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.
19:048:001	Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.
19:048:002	Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
19:048:003	God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
19:048:004	For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
19:048:005	They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.
19:048:006	Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
19:048:007	Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
19:048:008	As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.
19:048:009	We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
19:048:010	According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
19:048:011	Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.
19:048:012	Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.
19:048:013	Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.
19:048:014	For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
19:049:001	Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
19:049:002	Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
19:049:003	My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
19:049:004	I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
19:049:005	Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
19:049:006	They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
19:049:007	None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
19:049:008	(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
19:049:009	That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
19:049:010	For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
19:049:011	Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.
19:049:012	Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.
19:049:013	This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
19:049:014	Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
19:049:015	But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
19:049:016	Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
19:049:017	For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
19:049:018	Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
19:049:019	He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
19:049:020	Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
19:050:001	The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
19:050:002	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
19:050:003	Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
19:050:004	He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
19:050:005	Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
19:050:006	And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.
19:050:007	Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.
19:050:008	I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.
19:050:009	I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.
19:050:010	For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.
19:050:011	I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.
19:050:012	If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
19:050:013	Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
19:050:014	Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:
19:050:015	And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
19:050:016	But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?
19:050:017	Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee.
19:050:018	When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.
19:050:019	Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
19:050:020	Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
19:050:021	These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.
19:050:022	Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.
19:050:023	Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.
19:051:001	Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
19:051:002	Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
19:051:003	For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
19:051:004	Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.
19:051:005	Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
19:051:006	Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
19:051:007	Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
19:051:008	Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
19:051:009	Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
19:051:010	Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
19:051:011	Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
19:051:012	Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.
19:051:013	Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
19:051:014	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
19:051:015	O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
19:051:016	For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.
19:051:017	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
19:051:018	Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
19:051:019	Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
19:052:001	Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually.
19:052:002	The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
19:052:003	Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
19:052:004	Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
19:052:005	God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
19:052:006	The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
19:052:007	Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
19:052:008	But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
19:052:009	I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.
19:053:001	The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
19:053:002	God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
19:053:003	Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
19:053:004	Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
19:053:005	There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.
19:053:006	Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
19:054:001	Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
19:054:002	Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
19:054:003	For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
19:054:004	Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
19:054:005	He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
19:054:006	I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.
19:054:007	For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
19:055:001	Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
19:055:002	Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
19:055:003	Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
19:055:004	My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
19:055:005	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
19:055:006	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.
19:055:007	Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.
19:055:008	I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
19:055:009	Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
19:055:010	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
19:055:011	Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
19:055:012	For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
19:055:013	But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
19:055:014	We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.
19:055:015	Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
19:055:016	As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
19:055:017	Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.
19:055:018	He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.
19:055:019	God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
19:055:020	He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.
19:055:021	The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
19:055:022	Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
19:055:023	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
19:056:001	Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
19:056:002	Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.
19:056:003	What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
19:056:004	In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
19:056:005	Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.
19:056:006	They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
19:056:007	Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.
19:056:008	Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?
19:056:009	When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.
19:056:010	In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.
19:056:011	In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
19:056:012	Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
19:056:013	For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
19:057:001	Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.
19:057:002	I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.
19:057:003	He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
19:057:004	My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
19:057:005	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
19:057:006	They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.
19:057:007	My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.
19:057:008	Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
19:057:009	I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.
19:057:010	For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.
19:057:011	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.
19:058:001	Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
19:058:002	Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
19:058:003	The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
19:058:004	Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;
19:058:005	Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
19:058:006	Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
19:058:007	Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
19:058:008	As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
19:058:009	Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.
19:058:010	The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
19:058:011	So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
19:059:001	Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
19:059:002	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
19:059:003	For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.
19:059:004	They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.
19:059:005	Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.
19:059:006	They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
19:059:007	Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?
19:059:008	But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
19:059:009	Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.
19:059:010	The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
19:059:011	Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
19:059:012	For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.
19:059:013	Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
19:059:014	And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
19:059:015	Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
19:059:016	But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
19:059:017	Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.
19:060:001	O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
19:060:002	Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
19:060:003	Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
19:060:004	Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
19:060:005	That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.
19:060:006	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
19:060:007	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
19:060:008	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
19:060:009	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
19:060:010	Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?
19:060:011	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
19:060:012	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
19:061:001	Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
19:061:002	From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
19:061:003	For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
19:061:004	I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
19:061:005	For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.
19:061:006	Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.
19:061:007	He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.
19:061:008	So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
19:062:001	Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
19:062:002	He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
19:062:003	How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
19:062:004	They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
19:062:005	My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
19:062:006	He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
19:062:007	In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
19:062:008	Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.
19:062:009	Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
19:062:010	Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
19:062:011	God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.
19:062:012	Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
19:063:001	O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
19:063:002	To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
19:063:003	Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
19:063:004	Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
19:063:005	My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:
19:063:006	When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
19:063:007	Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
19:063:008	My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
19:063:009	But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
19:063:010	They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
19:063:011	But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
19:064:001	Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
19:064:002	Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
19:064:003	Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:
19:064:004	That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
19:064:005	They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
19:064:006	They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.
19:064:007	But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
19:064:008	So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.
19:064:009	And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
19:064:010	The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
19:065:001	Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
19:065:002	O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
19:065:003	Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
19:065:004	Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
19:065:005	By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:
19:065:006	Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:
19:065:007	Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
19:065:008	They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
19:065:009	Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
19:065:010	Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.
19:065:011	Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.
19:065:012	They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.
19:065:013	The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
19:066:001	Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
19:066:002	Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
19:066:003	Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
19:066:004	All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.
19:066:005	Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
19:066:006	He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
19:066:007	He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
19:066:008	O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
19:066:009	Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
19:066:010	For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
19:066:011	Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.
19:066:012	Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
19:066:013	I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
19:066:014	Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
19:066:015	I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
19:066:016	Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
19:066:017	I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
19:066:018	If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
19:066:019	But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
19:066:020	Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
19:067:001	God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.
19:067:002	That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.
19:067:003	Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
19:067:004	O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
19:067:005	Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
19:067:006	Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.
19:067:007	God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
19:068:001	Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.
19:068:002	As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
19:068:003	But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.
19:068:004	Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.
19:068:005	A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.
19:068:006	God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
19:068:007	O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:
19:068:008	The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
19:068:009	Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
19:068:010	Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.
19:068:011	The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.
19:068:012	Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.
19:068:013	Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.
19:068:014	When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.
19:068:015	The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.
19:068:016	Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.
19:068:017	The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.
19:068:018	Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.
19:068:019	Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.
19:068:020	He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.
19:068:021	But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.
19:068:022	The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:
19:068:023	That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.
19:068:024	They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.
19:068:025	The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.
19:068:026	Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.
19:068:027	There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.
19:068:028	Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
19:068:029	Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.
19:068:030	Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.
19:068:031	Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.
19:068:032	Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:
19:068:033	To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.
19:068:034	Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.
19:068:035	O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
19:069:001	Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
19:069:002	I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
19:069:003	I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
19:069:004	They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
19:069:005	O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
19:069:006	Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
19:069:007	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
19:069:008	I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.
19:069:009	For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
19:069:010	When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
19:069:011	I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
19:069:012	They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.
19:069:013	But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
19:069:014	Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
19:069:015	Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
19:069:016	Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
19:069:017	And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
19:069:018	Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
19:069:019	Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.
19:069:020	Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
19:069:021	They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
19:069:022	Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
19:069:023	Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
19:069:024	Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
19:069:025	Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
19:069:026	For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
19:069:027	Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.
19:069:028	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
19:069:029	But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
19:069:030	I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
19:069:031	This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
19:069:032	The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.
19:069:033	For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
19:069:034	Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
19:069:035	For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
19:069:036	The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
19:070:001	MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.
19:070:002	Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
19:070:003	Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
19:070:004	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
19:070:005	But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
19:071:001	In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.
19:071:002	Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
19:071:003	Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.
19:071:004	Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
19:071:005	For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.
19:071:006	By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.
19:071:007	I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
19:071:008	Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.
19:071:009	Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
19:071:010	For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
19:071:011	Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.
19:071:012	O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
19:071:013	Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
19:071:014	But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
19:071:015	My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
19:071:016	I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
19:071:017	O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
19:071:018	Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.
19:071:019	Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!
19:071:020	Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
19:071:021	Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
19:071:022	I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
19:071:023	My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
19:071:024	My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
19:072:001	Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
19:072:002	He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
19:072:003	The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
19:072:004	He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
19:072:005	They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
19:072:006	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.
19:072:007	In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
19:072:008	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
19:072:009	They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
19:072:010	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
19:072:011	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
19:072:012	For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
19:072:013	He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
19:072:014	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
19:072:015	And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.
19:072:016	There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
19:072:017	His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
19:072:018	Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
19:072:019	And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.
19:072:020	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
19:073:001	Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
19:073:002	But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
19:073:003	For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
19:073:004	For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
19:073:005	They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
19:073:006	Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
19:073:007	Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
19:073:008	They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.
19:073:009	They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
19:073:010	Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
19:073:011	And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
19:073:012	Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
19:073:013	Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
19:073:014	For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
19:073:015	If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
19:073:016	When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
19:073:017	Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
19:073:018	Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.
19:073:019	How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
19:073:020	As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
19:073:021	Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
19:073:022	So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
19:073:023	Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.
19:073:024	Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
19:073:025	Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
19:073:026	My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
19:073:027	For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
19:073:028	But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
19:074:001	O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
19:074:002	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
19:074:003	Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
19:074:004	Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.
19:074:005	A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
19:074:006	But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
19:074:007	They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
19:074:008	They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
19:074:009	We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
19:074:010	O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
19:074:011	Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.
19:074:012	For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
19:074:013	Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
19:074:014	Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
19:074:015	Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.
19:074:016	The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
19:074:017	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
19:074:018	Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
19:074:019	O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
19:074:020	Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
19:074:021	O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
19:074:022	Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
19:074:023	Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
19:075:001	Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
19:075:002	When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
19:075:003	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.
19:075:004	I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
19:075:005	Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
19:075:006	For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
19:075:007	But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
19:075:008	For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.
19:075:009	But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
19:075:010	All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
19:076:001	In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
19:076:002	In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
19:076:003	There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
19:076:004	Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
19:076:005	The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
19:076:006	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
19:076:007	Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
19:076:008	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
19:076:009	When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
19:076:010	Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
19:076:011	Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
19:076:012	He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
19:077:001	I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
19:077:002	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
19:077:003	I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
19:077:004	Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
19:077:005	I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
19:077:006	I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
19:077:007	Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
19:077:008	Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
19:077:009	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
19:077:010	And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
19:077:011	I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
19:077:012	I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
19:077:013	Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?
19:077:014	Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
19:077:015	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
19:077:016	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
19:077:017	The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
19:077:018	The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
19:077:019	Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
19:077:020	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
19:078:001	Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
19:078:002	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
19:078:003	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
19:078:004	We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
19:078:005	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
19:078:006	That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
19:078:007	That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
19:078:008	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
19:078:009	The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
19:078:010	They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
19:078:011	And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
19:078:012	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
19:078:013	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
19:078:014	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
19:078:015	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
19:078:016	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
19:078:017	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
19:078:018	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
19:078:019	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
19:078:020	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
19:078:021	Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
19:078:022	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
19:078:023	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
19:078:024	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
19:078:025	Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
19:078:026	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
19:078:027	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
19:078:028	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
19:078:029	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
19:078:030	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
19:078:031	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
19:078:032	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
19:078:033	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
19:078:034	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
19:078:035	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
19:078:036	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
19:078:037	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
19:078:038	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
19:078:039	For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
19:078:040	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
19:078:041	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
19:078:042	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
19:078:043	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
19:078:044	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
19:078:045	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
19:078:046	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
19:078:047	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
19:078:048	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
19:078:049	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
19:078:050	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
19:078:051	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
19:078:052	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
19:078:053	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
19:078:054	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
19:078:055	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
19:078:056	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
19:078:057	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
19:078:058	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
19:078:059	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
19:078:060	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
19:078:061	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
19:078:062	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
19:078:063	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
19:078:064	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
19:078:065	Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
19:078:066	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
19:078:067	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
19:078:068	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
19:078:069	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
19:078:070	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
19:078:071	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
19:078:072	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
19:079:001	O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
19:079:002	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
19:079:003	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
19:079:004	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
19:079:005	How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
19:079:006	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
19:079:007	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
19:079:008	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
19:079:009	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
19:079:010	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.
19:079:011	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
19:079:012	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
19:079:013	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
19:080:001	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
19:080:002	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
19:080:003	Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
19:080:004	O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
19:080:005	Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
19:080:006	Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
19:080:007	Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
19:080:008	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
19:080:009	Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
19:080:010	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.
19:080:011	She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
19:080:012	Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
19:080:013	The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
19:080:014	Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
19:080:015	And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
19:080:016	It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
19:080:017	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
19:080:018	So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
19:080:019	Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
19:081:001	Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
19:081:002	Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
19:081:003	Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
19:081:004	For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
19:081:005	This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.
19:081:006	I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
19:081:007	Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
19:081:008	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
19:081:009	There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
19:081:010	I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
19:081:011	But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
19:081:012	So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
19:081:013	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!
19:081:014	I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
19:081:015	The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
19:081:016	He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
19:082:001	God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
19:082:002	How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
19:082:003	Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
19:082:004	Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
19:082:005	They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
19:082:006	I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
19:082:007	But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
19:082:008	Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
19:083:001	Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
19:083:002	For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
19:083:003	They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
19:083:004	They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
19:083:005	For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
19:083:006	The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
19:083:007	Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
19:083:008	Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
19:083:009	Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
19:083:010	Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
19:083:011	Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
19:083:012	Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
19:083:013	O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
19:083:014	As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
19:083:015	So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
19:083:016	Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
19:083:017	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
19:083:018	That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.
19:084:001	How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
19:084:002	My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
19:084:003	Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.
19:084:004	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
19:084:005	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
19:084:006	Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
19:084:007	They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
19:084:008	O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
19:084:009	Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
19:084:010	For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
19:084:011	For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
19:084:012	O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
19:085:001	Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
19:085:002	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
19:085:003	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
19:085:004	Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
19:085:005	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
19:085:006	Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
19:085:007	Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
19:085:008	I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
19:085:009	Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
19:085:010	Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
19:085:011	Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
19:085:012	Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.
19:085:013	Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
19:086:001	Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
19:086:002	Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
19:086:003	Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
19:086:004	Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
19:086:005	For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
19:086:006	Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.
19:086:007	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
19:086:008	Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.
19:086:009	All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
19:086:010	For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
19:086:011	Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
19:086:012	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
19:086:013	For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
19:086:014	O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
19:086:015	But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
19:086:016	O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
19:086:017	Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
19:087:001	His foundation is in the holy mountains.
19:087:002	The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
19:087:003	Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
19:087:004	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
19:087:005	And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.
19:087:006	The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.
19:087:007	As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.
19:088:001	O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:
19:088:002	Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
19:088:003	For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
19:088:004	I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:
19:088:005	Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
19:088:006	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
19:088:007	Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.
19:088:008	Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
19:088:009	Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
19:088:010	Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.
19:088:011	Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?
19:088:012	Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
19:088:013	But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
19:088:014	LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?
19:088:015	I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
19:088:016	Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
19:088:017	They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
19:088:018	Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
19:089:001	I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
19:089:002	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
19:089:003	I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,
19:089:004	Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
19:089:005	And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
19:089:006	For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
19:089:007	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
19:089:008	O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
19:089:009	Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
19:089:010	Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
19:089:011	The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
19:089:012	The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
19:089:013	Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
19:089:014	Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
19:089:015	Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
19:089:016	In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
19:089:017	For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
19:089:018	For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.
19:089:019	Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
19:089:020	I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
19:089:021	With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.
19:089:022	The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
19:089:023	And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.
19:089:024	But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
19:089:025	I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
19:089:026	He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
19:089:027	Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
19:089:028	My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
19:089:029	His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
19:089:030	If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
19:089:031	If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
19:089:032	Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
19:089:033	Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
19:089:034	My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
19:089:035	Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
19:089:036	His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
19:089:037	It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
19:089:038	But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
19:089:039	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
19:089:040	Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
19:089:041	All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
19:089:042	Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
19:089:043	Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
19:089:044	Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.
19:089:045	The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
19:089:046	How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?
19:089:047	Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
19:089:048	What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
19:089:049	Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
19:089:050	Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
19:089:051	Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
19:089:052	Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
19:090:001	Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
19:090:002	Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
19:090:003	Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
19:090:004	For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
19:090:005	Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
19:090:006	In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
19:090:007	For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
19:090:008	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
19:090:009	For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.
19:090:010	The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
19:090:011	Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.
19:090:012	So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
19:090:013	Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
19:090:014	O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
19:090:015	Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.
19:090:016	Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.
19:090:017	And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
19:091:001	He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
19:091:002	I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
19:091:003	Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
19:091:004	He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
19:091:005	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
19:091:006	Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
19:091:007	A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
19:091:008	Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
19:091:009	Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
19:091:010	There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
19:091:011	For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
19:091:012	They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
19:091:013	Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
19:091:014	Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
19:091:015	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
19:091:016	With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
19:092:001	IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:
19:092:002	To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
19:092:003	Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
19:092:004	For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
19:092:005	O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.
19:092:006	A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
19:092:007	When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:
19:092:008	But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
19:092:009	For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
19:092:010	But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
19:092:011	Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
19:092:012	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
19:092:013	Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.
19:092:014	They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
19:092:015	To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
19:093:001	The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
19:093:002	Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
19:093:003	The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
19:093:004	The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
19:093:005	Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
19:094:001	O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.
19:094:002	Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
19:094:003	LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
19:094:004	How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
19:094:005	They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.
19:094:006	They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
19:094:007	Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.
19:094:008	Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?
19:094:009	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
19:094:010	He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
19:094:011	The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
19:094:012	Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;
19:094:013	That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.
19:094:014	For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
19:094:015	But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
19:094:016	Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
19:094:017	Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
19:094:018	When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
19:094:019	In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
19:094:020	Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?
19:094:021	They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
19:094:022	But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
19:094:023	And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
19:095:001	O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
19:095:002	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
19:095:003	For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
19:095:004	In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.
19:095:005	The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
19:095:006	O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.
19:095:007	For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
19:095:008	Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
19:095:009	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
19:095:010	Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
19:095:011	Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
19:096:001	O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.
19:096:002	Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
19:096:003	Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
19:096:004	For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
19:096:005	For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
19:096:006	Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
19:096:007	Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
19:096:008	Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
19:096:009	O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
19:096:010	Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
19:096:011	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
19:096:012	Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
19:096:013	Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
19:097:001	The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.
19:097:002	Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.
19:097:003	A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.
19:097:004	His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.
19:097:005	The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
19:097:006	The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
19:097:007	Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.
19:097:008	Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.
19:097:009	For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.
19:097:010	Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
19:097:011	Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
19:097:012	Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
19:098:001	O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
19:098:002	The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
19:098:003	He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
19:098:004	Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
19:098:005	Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
19:098:006	With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
19:098:007	Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
19:098:008	Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
19:098:009	Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
19:099:001	The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.
19:099:002	The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.
19:099:003	Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.
19:099:004	The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
19:099:005	Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
19:099:006	Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
19:099:007	He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.
19:099:008	Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
19:099:009	Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
19:100:001	Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
19:100:002	Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.
19:100:003	Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
19:100:004	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
19:100:005	For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
19:101:001	I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.
19:101:002	I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
19:101:003	I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
19:101:004	A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
19:101:005	Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
19:101:006	Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
19:101:007	He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
19:101:008	I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
19:102:001	Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
19:102:002	Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.
19:102:003	For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.
19:102:004	My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.
19:102:005	By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.
19:102:006	I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
19:102:007	I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
19:102:008	Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
19:102:009	For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.
19:102:010	Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
19:102:011	My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.
19:102:012	But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.
19:102:013	Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
19:102:014	For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.
19:102:015	So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
19:102:016	When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.
19:102:017	He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
19:102:018	This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
19:102:019	For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
19:102:020	To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;
19:102:021	To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
19:102:022	When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
19:102:023	He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
19:102:024	I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.
19:102:025	Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
19:102:026	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
19:102:027	But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
19:102:028	The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
19:103:001	Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
19:103:002	Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
19:103:003	Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
19:103:004	Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
19:103:005	Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
19:103:006	The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
19:103:007	He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
19:103:008	The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
19:103:009	He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
19:103:010	He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
19:103:011	For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
19:103:012	As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
19:103:013	Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
19:103:014	For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
19:103:015	As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
19:103:016	For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
19:103:017	But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
19:103:018	To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
19:103:019	The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
19:103:020	Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
19:103:021	Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
19:103:022	Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
19:104:001	Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
19:104:002	Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
19:104:003	Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
19:104:004	Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
19:104:005	Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
19:104:006	Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
19:104:007	At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
19:104:008	They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
19:104:009	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
19:104:010	He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
19:104:011	They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
19:104:012	By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.
19:104:013	He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
19:104:014	He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
19:104:015	And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
19:104:016	The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
19:104:017	Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
19:104:018	The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.
19:104:019	He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
19:104:020	Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
19:104:021	The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
19:104:022	The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
19:104:023	Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
19:104:024	O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
19:104:025	So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
19:104:026	There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
19:104:027	These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
19:104:028	That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
19:104:029	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
19:104:030	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
19:104:031	The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
19:104:032	He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
19:104:033	I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
19:104:034	My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
19:104:035	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
19:105:001	O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.
19:105:002	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
19:105:003	Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
19:105:004	Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
19:105:005	Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
19:105:006	O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
19:105:007	He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
19:105:008	He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
19:105:009	Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
19:105:010	And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
19:105:011	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
19:105:012	When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
19:105:013	When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
19:105:014	He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
19:105:015	Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
19:105:016	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
19:105:017	He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
19:105:018	Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
19:105:019	Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
19:105:020	The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
19:105:021	He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
19:105:022	To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
19:105:023	Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
19:105:024	And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
19:105:025	He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
19:105:026	He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
19:105:027	They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
19:105:028	He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
19:105:029	He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
19:105:030	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
19:105:031	He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.
19:105:032	He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
19:105:033	He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
19:105:034	He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
19:105:035	And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
19:105:036	He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
19:105:037	He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
19:105:038	Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
19:105:039	He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
19:105:040	The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
19:105:041	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.
19:105:042	For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
19:105:043	And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:
19:105:044	And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
19:105:045	That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
19:106:001	Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:106:002	Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?
19:106:003	Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
19:106:004	Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
19:106:005	That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
19:106:006	We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
19:106:007	Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.
19:106:008	Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
19:106:009	He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
19:106:010	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
19:106:011	And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
19:106:012	Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
19:106:013	They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
19:106:014	But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
19:106:015	And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
19:106:016	They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
19:106:017	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.
19:106:018	And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
19:106:019	They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
19:106:020	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
19:106:021	They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
19:106:022	Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
19:106:023	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
19:106:024	Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
19:106:025	But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
19:106:026	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
19:106:027	To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
19:106:028	They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
19:106:029	Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
19:106:030	Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
19:106:031	And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
19:106:032	They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
19:106:033	Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
19:106:034	They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
19:106:035	But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
19:106:036	And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
19:106:037	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
19:106:038	And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
19:106:039	Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
19:106:040	Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
19:106:041	And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
19:106:042	Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
19:106:043	Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
19:106:044	Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
19:106:045	And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
19:106:046	He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
19:106:047	Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.
19:106:048	Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
19:107:001	O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:107:002	Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
19:107:003	And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
19:107:004	They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
19:107:005	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
19:107:006	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
19:107:007	And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
19:107:008	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
19:107:009	For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
19:107:010	Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;
19:107:011	Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
19:107:012	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.
19:107:013	Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.
19:107:014	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
19:107:015	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
19:107:016	For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
19:107:017	Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
19:107:018	Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
19:107:019	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.
19:107:020	He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
19:107:021	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
19:107:022	And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
19:107:023	They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
19:107:024	These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
19:107:025	For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
19:107:026	They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
19:107:027	They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end.
19:107:028	Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
19:107:029	He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
19:107:030	Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
19:107:031	Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
19:107:032	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
19:107:033	He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
19:107:034	A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
19:107:035	He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
19:107:036	And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
19:107:037	And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
19:107:038	He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
19:107:039	Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
19:107:040	He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
19:107:041	Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.
19:107:042	The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
19:107:043	Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
19:108:001	O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
19:108:002	Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
19:108:003	I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
19:108:004	For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
19:108:005	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
19:108:006	That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
19:108:007	God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
19:108:008	Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
19:108:009	Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
19:108:010	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
19:108:011	Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
19:108:012	Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
19:108:013	Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
19:109:001	Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
19:109:002	For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
19:109:003	They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
19:109:004	For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.
19:109:005	And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
19:109:006	Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
19:109:007	When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
19:109:008	Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
19:109:009	Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
19:109:010	Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.
19:109:011	Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
19:109:012	Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
19:109:013	Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
19:109:014	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
19:109:015	Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
19:109:016	Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
19:109:017	As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.
19:109:018	As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
19:109:019	Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
19:109:020	Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
19:109:021	But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.
19:109:022	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
19:109:023	I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.
19:109:024	My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
19:109:025	I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.
19:109:026	Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
19:109:027	That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.
19:109:028	Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
19:109:029	Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
19:109:030	I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
19:109:031	For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
19:110:001	The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
19:110:002	The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
19:110:003	Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
19:110:004	The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
19:110:005	The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
19:110:006	He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
19:110:007	He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
19:111:001	Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
19:111:002	The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
19:111:003	His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
19:111:004	He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
19:111:005	He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
19:111:006	He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
19:111:007	The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.
19:111:008	They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.
19:111:009	He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.
19:111:010	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
19:112:001	Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.
19:112:002	His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
19:112:003	Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
19:112:004	Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
19:112:005	A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.
19:112:006	Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
19:112:007	He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.
19:112:008	His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.
19:112:009	He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
19:112:010	The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
19:113:001	Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.
19:113:002	Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.
19:113:003	From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised.
19:113:004	The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.
19:113:005	Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
19:113:006	Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
19:113:007	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
19:113:008	That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
19:113:009	He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
19:114:001	When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
19:114:002	Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
19:114:003	The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
19:114:004	The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
19:114:005	What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
19:114:006	Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
19:114:007	Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
19:114:008	Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
19:115:001	Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
19:115:002	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
19:115:003	But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
19:115:004	Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
19:115:005	They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
19:115:006	They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
19:115:007	They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
19:115:008	They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
19:115:009	O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
19:115:010	O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
19:115:011	Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
19:115:012	The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
19:115:013	He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
19:115:014	The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
19:115:015	Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
19:115:016	The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
19:115:017	The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
19:115:018	But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
19:116:001	I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.
19:116:002	Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
19:116:003	The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
19:116:004	Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
19:116:005	Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
19:116:006	The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
19:116:007	Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
19:116:008	For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
19:116:009	I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
19:116:010	I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
19:116:011	I said in my haste, All men are liars.
19:116:012	What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?
19:116:013	I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.
19:116:014	I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
19:116:015	Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.
19:116:016	O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
19:116:017	I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.
19:116:018	I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
19:116:019	In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
19:117:001	O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
19:117:002	For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.
19:118:001	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.
19:118:002	Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
19:118:003	Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
19:118:004	Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
19:118:005	I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.
19:118:006	The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?
19:118:007	The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
19:118:008	It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
19:118:009	It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.
19:118:010	All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.
19:118:011	They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
19:118:012	They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
19:118:013	Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.
19:118:014	The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
19:118:015	The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
19:118:016	The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
19:118:017	I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.
19:118:018	The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.
19:118:019	Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:
19:118:020	This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
19:118:021	I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.
19:118:022	The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.
19:118:023	This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
19:118:024	This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
19:118:025	Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.
19:118:026	Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.
19:118:027	God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.
19:118:028	Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.
19:118:029	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:119:001	Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.
19:119:002	Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.
19:119:003	They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.
19:119:004	Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.
19:119:005	O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!
19:119:006	Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.
19:119:007	I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.
19:119:008	I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.
19:119:009	Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.
19:119:010	With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.
19:119:011	Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
19:119:012	Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.
19:119:013	With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
19:119:014	I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.
19:119:015	I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.
19:119:016	I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.
19:119:017	Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.
19:119:018	Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
19:119:019	I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.
19:119:020	My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.
19:119:021	Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.
19:119:022	Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.
19:119:023	Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.
19:119:024	Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.
19:119:025	My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.
19:119:026	I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.
19:119:027	Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.
19:119:028	My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.
19:119:029	Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.
19:119:030	I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.
19:119:031	I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.
19:119:032	I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.
19:119:033	Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.
19:119:034	Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.
19:119:035	Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.
19:119:036	Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
19:119:037	Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.
19:119:038	Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.
19:119:039	Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.
19:119:040	Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.
19:119:041	Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.
19:119:042	So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.
19:119:043	And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.
19:119:044	So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
19:119:045	And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.
19:119:046	I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.
19:119:047	And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.
19:119:048	My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.
19:119:049	Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.
19:119:050	This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.
19:119:051	The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.
19:119:052	I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.
19:119:053	Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
19:119:054	Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
19:119:055	I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.
19:119:056	This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
19:119:057	Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.
19:119:058	I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.
19:119:059	I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
19:119:060	I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
19:119:061	The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.
19:119:062	At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.
19:119:063	I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.
19:119:064	The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.
19:119:065	Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.
19:119:066	Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.
19:119:067	Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.
19:119:068	Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
19:119:069	The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.
19:119:070	Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.
19:119:071	It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.
19:119:072	The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.
19:119:073	Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.
19:119:074	They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.
19:119:075	I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
19:119:076	Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.
19:119:077	Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.
19:119:078	Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.
19:119:079	Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.
19:119:080	Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
19:119:081	My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.
19:119:082	Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
19:119:083	For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.
19:119:084	How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
19:119:085	The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.
19:119:086	All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.
19:119:087	They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.
19:119:088	Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.
19:119:089	For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.
19:119:090	Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
19:119:091	They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.
19:119:092	Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.
19:119:093	I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.
19:119:094	I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.
19:119:095	The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.
19:119:096	I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.
19:119:097	O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.
19:119:098	Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.
19:119:099	I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.
19:119:100	I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.
19:119:101	I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.
19:119:102	I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.
19:119:103	How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
19:119:104	Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.
19:119:105	Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
19:119:106	I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
19:119:107	I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.
19:119:108	Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.
19:119:109	My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.
19:119:110	The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.
19:119:111	Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.
19:119:112	I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.
19:119:113	I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.
19:119:114	Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
19:119:115	Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.
19:119:116	Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.
19:119:117	Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
19:119:118	Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.
19:119:119	Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.
19:119:120	My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.
19:119:121	I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.
19:119:122	Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.
19:119:123	Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.
19:119:124	Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.
19:119:125	I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.
19:119:126	It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.
19:119:127	Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.
19:119:128	Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.
19:119:129	Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.
19:119:130	The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.
19:119:131	I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.
19:119:132	Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.
19:119:133	Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
19:119:134	Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.
19:119:135	Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.
19:119:136	Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.
19:119:137	Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.
19:119:138	Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.
19:119:139	My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.
19:119:140	Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.
19:119:141	I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.
19:119:142	Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.
19:119:143	Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.
19:119:144	The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.
19:119:145	I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.
19:119:146	I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
19:119:147	I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.
19:119:148	Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.
19:119:149	Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.
19:119:150	They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.
19:119:151	Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.
19:119:152	Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.
19:119:153	Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.
19:119:154	Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.
19:119:155	Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.
19:119:156	Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.
19:119:157	Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.
19:119:158	I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.
19:119:159	Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.
19:119:160	Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.
19:119:161	Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.
19:119:162	I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.
19:119:163	I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.
19:119:164	Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.
19:119:165	Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.
19:119:166	LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.
19:119:167	My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.
19:119:168	I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.
19:119:169	Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.
19:119:170	Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.
19:119:171	My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
19:119:172	My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.
19:119:173	Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.
19:119:174	I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight.
19:119:175	Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.
19:119:176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.
19:120:001	In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.
19:120:002	Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.
19:120:003	What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
19:120:004	Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
19:120:005	Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
19:120:006	My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
19:120:007	I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
19:121:001	I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
19:121:002	My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
19:121:003	He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
19:121:004	Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
19:121:005	The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.
19:121:006	The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
19:121:007	The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.
19:121:008	The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
19:122:001	I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.
19:122:002	Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
19:122:003	Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
19:122:004	Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
19:122:005	For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
19:122:006	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.
19:122:007	Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
19:122:008	For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
19:122:009	Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
19:123:001	Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
19:123:002	Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
19:123:003	Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
19:123:004	Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
19:124:001	If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;
19:124:002	If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
19:124:003	Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
19:124:004	Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
19:124:005	Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
19:124:006	Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
19:124:007	Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
19:124:008	Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
19:125:001	They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.
19:125:002	As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
19:125:003	For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
19:125:004	Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.
19:125:005	As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
19:126:001	When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
19:126:002	Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
19:126:003	The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
19:126:004	Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
19:126:005	They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
19:126:006	He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
19:127:001	Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
19:127:002	It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
19:127:003	Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
19:127:004	As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.
19:127:005	Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
19:128:001	Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
19:128:002	For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
19:128:003	Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
19:128:004	Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
19:128:005	The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
19:128:006	Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
19:129:001	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
19:129:002	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
19:129:003	The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
19:129:004	The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
19:129:005	Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
19:129:006	Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
19:129:007	Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
19:129:008	Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
19:130:001	Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
19:130:002	Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
19:130:003	If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
19:130:004	But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
19:130:005	I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
19:130:006	My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
19:130:007	Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
19:130:008	And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
19:131:001	Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
19:131:002	Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
19:131:003	Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
19:132:001	Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:
19:132:002	How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;
19:132:003	Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
19:132:004	I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,
19:132:005	Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.
19:132:006	Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
19:132:007	We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
19:132:008	Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
19:132:009	Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.
19:132:010	For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.
19:132:011	The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
19:132:012	If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.
19:132:013	For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.
19:132:014	This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
19:132:015	I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
19:132:016	I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
19:132:017	There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
19:132:018	His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
19:133:001	Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
19:133:002	It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;
19:133:003	As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
19:134:001	Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.
19:134:002	Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.
19:134:003	The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.
19:135:001	Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.
19:135:002	Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.
19:135:003	Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
19:135:004	For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
19:135:005	For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
19:135:006	Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
19:135:007	He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
19:135:008	Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
19:135:009	Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
19:135:010	Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
19:135:011	Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
19:135:012	And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
19:135:013	Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.
19:135:014	For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
19:135:015	The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
19:135:016	They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
19:135:017	They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
19:135:018	They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.
19:135:019	Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:
19:135:020	Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
19:135:021	Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
19:136:001	O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:002	O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:003	O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:004	To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:005	To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:006	To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:007	To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:008	The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:009	The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:010	To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:011	And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:012	With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:013	To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:014	And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:015	But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:016	To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:017	To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:018	And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:019	Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:020	And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:021	And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:022	Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:023	Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever:
19:136:024	And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:025	Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:136:026	O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
19:137:001	By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
19:137:002	We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
19:137:003	For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
19:137:004	How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?
19:137:005	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.
19:137:006	If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
19:137:007	Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.
19:137:008	O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
19:137:009	Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
19:138:001	I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.
19:138:002	I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
19:138:003	In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.
19:138:004	All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.
19:138:005	Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD.
19:138:006	Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.
19:138:007	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
19:138:008	The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.
19:139:001	O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.
19:139:002	Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
19:139:003	Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
19:139:004	For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.
19:139:005	Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
19:139:006	Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
19:139:007	Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
19:139:008	If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
19:139:009	If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
19:139:010	Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
19:139:011	If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.
19:139:012	Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
19:139:013	For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.
19:139:014	I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
19:139:015	My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
19:139:016	Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
19:139:017	How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!
19:139:018	If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
19:139:019	Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
19:139:020	For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
19:139:021	Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
19:139:022	I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
19:139:023	Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:
19:139:024	And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.
19:140:001	Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;
19:140:002	Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.
19:140:003	They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.
19:140:004	Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
19:140:005	The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.
19:140:006	I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.
19:140:007	O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
19:140:008	Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.
19:140:009	As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
19:140:010	Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
19:140:011	Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
19:140:012	I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.
19:140:013	Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
19:141:001	Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
19:141:002	Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
19:141:003	Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
19:141:004	Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
19:141:005	Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
19:141:006	When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
19:141:007	Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.
19:141:008	But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
19:141:009	Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
19:141:010	Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
19:142:001	I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.
19:142:002	I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.
19:142:003	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
19:142:004	I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
19:142:005	I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
19:142:006	Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
19:142:007	Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
19:143:001	Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
19:143:002	And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
19:143:003	For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
19:143:004	Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
19:143:005	I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
19:143:006	I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
19:143:007	Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
19:143:008	Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
19:143:009	Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
19:143:010	Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
19:143:011	Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
19:143:012	And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
19:144:001	Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:
19:144:002	My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
19:144:003	LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
19:144:004	Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
19:144:005	Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
19:144:006	Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
19:144:007	Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
19:144:008	Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
19:144:009	I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
19:144:010	It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
19:144:011	Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:
19:144:012	That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:
19:144:013	That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:
19:144:014	That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.
19:144:015	Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.
19:145:001	I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
19:145:002	Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
19:145:003	Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.
19:145:004	One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.
19:145:005	I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.
19:145:006	And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.
19:145:007	They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.
19:145:008	The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.
19:145:009	The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
19:145:010	All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.
19:145:011	They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;
19:145:012	To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
19:145:013	Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
19:145:014	The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
19:145:015	The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.
19:145:016	Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
19:145:017	The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
19:145:018	The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
19:145:019	He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
19:145:020	The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.
19:145:021	My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
19:146:001	Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
19:146:002	While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
19:146:003	Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
19:146:004	His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
19:146:005	Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:
19:146:006	Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:
19:146:007	Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:
19:146:008	The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:
19:146:009	The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
19:146:010	The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
19:147:001	Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.
19:147:002	The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.
19:147:003	He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
19:147:004	He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.
19:147:005	Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.
19:147:006	The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.
19:147:007	Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:
19:147:008	Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
19:147:009	He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.
19:147:010	He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.
19:147:011	The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.
19:147:012	Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
19:147:013	For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.
19:147:014	He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
19:147:015	He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.
19:147:016	He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.
19:147:017	He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
19:147:018	He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
19:147:019	He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
19:147:020	He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.
19:148:001	Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.
19:148:002	Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.
19:148:003	Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.
19:148:004	Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.
19:148:005	Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.
19:148:006	He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.
19:148:007	Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:
19:148:008	Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word:
19:148:009	Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
19:148:010	Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
19:148:011	Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:
19:148:012	Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
19:148:013	Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.
19:148:014	He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
19:149:001	Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.
19:149:002	Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
19:149:003	Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.
19:149:004	For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.
19:149:005	Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.
19:149:006	Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand;
19:149:007	To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;
19:149:008	To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
19:149:009	To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
19:150:001	Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.
19:150:002	Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.
19:150:003	Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.
19:150:004	Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.
19:150:005	Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.
19:150:006	Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
