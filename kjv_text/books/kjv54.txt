54:001:001	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;
54:001:002	Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
54:001:003	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
54:001:004	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.
54:001:005	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:
54:001:006	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
54:001:007	Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
54:001:008	But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;
54:001:009	Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
54:001:010	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
54:001:011	According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
54:001:012	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
54:001:013	Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
54:001:014	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
54:001:015	This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
54:001:016	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
54:001:017	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
54:001:018	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
54:001:019	Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
54:001:020	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
54:002:001	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
54:002:002	For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
54:002:003	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
54:002:004	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
54:002:005	For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
54:002:006	Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
54:002:007	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
54:002:008	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
54:002:009	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
54:002:010	But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
54:002:011	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
54:002:012	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
54:002:013	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
54:002:014	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
54:002:015	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
54:003:001	This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
54:003:002	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
54:003:003	Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
54:003:004	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
54:003:005	(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
54:003:006	Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
54:003:007	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
54:003:008	Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
54:003:009	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
54:003:010	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.
54:003:011	Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.
54:003:012	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
54:003:013	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
54:003:014	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
54:003:015	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
54:003:016	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
54:004:001	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
54:004:002	Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
54:004:003	Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
54:004:004	For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
54:004:005	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
54:004:006	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
54:004:007	But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.
54:004:008	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
54:004:009	This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
54:004:010	For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
54:004:011	These things command and teach.
54:004:012	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
54:004:013	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
54:004:014	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
54:004:015	Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
54:004:016	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
54:005:001	Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;
54:005:002	The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
54:005:003	Honour widows that are widows indeed.
54:005:004	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.
54:005:005	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
54:005:006	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
54:005:007	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
54:005:008	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
54:005:009	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.
54:005:010	Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.
54:005:011	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;
54:005:012	Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
54:005:013	And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
54:005:014	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
54:005:015	For some are already turned aside after Satan.
54:005:016	If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
54:005:017	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
54:005:018	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.
54:005:019	Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
54:005:020	Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
54:005:021	I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.
54:005:022	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.
54:005:023	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.
54:005:024	Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.
54:005:025	Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
54:006:001	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
54:006:002	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
54:006:003	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
54:006:004	He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
54:006:005	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
54:006:006	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
54:006:007	For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
54:006:008	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
54:006:009	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
54:006:010	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
54:006:011	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
54:006:012	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
54:006:013	I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;
54:006:014	That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
54:006:015	Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
54:006:016	Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.
54:006:017	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
54:006:018	That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
54:006:019	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
54:006:020	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:
54:006:021	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
