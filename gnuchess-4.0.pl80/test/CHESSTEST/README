Chess Test Suite by Kevin Lang and Warren Smith.

The test suite is in the files ending with ".fin". Total of 5551
positions as of June 1993. Some extra positions are in "oldpos.wds",
but they are not converted into our standard format. Also,
"plagiarism" contains known repeats.

The files ending ".gnu" are the results of a run of gnuchess 4.0 pl62,
running on SGI Indigos with 50MHz R4000 MIPS RISC processors, at 1
minute CPU time per problem, on the corresponding .fin files. The
".gnu15" files are same but with 15 minutes CPU time per problem.

The files ending ".ps" are documentation explaining everything.  They
need to be printed out on a "postscript" printer.  "samplepos.ps" is
the chessboard figure filling the blank spot on page 4 of "testpos.ps",
which is the main item of documentation, in fact is the article we
submitted to ICCA Journal.
