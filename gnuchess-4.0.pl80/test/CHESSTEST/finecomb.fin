##50 Positions from R. Fine: World's greatest chess games.  These are
#among the most difficult combinations ever played over the board, Fine
#seems to imply. It is far from clear, though, how correct they are and
#whether the indicated best move is always unique. Usually is.
#Gnuchess got only 8 right out of these 50 at 1 minute per move setting.

r1qnk2r/ppp2ppp/1b5n/4p1Nb/2B1P3/BQP2P2/P5PP/RN1R3K/w Rd1xNd8+ (Fine_WGCG) (page 9, Capt. Evans.) Led to mate in the game, but should've led to less. Gnuchess finds the cook Qb3b5+, leading to major material gain...

brk4r/p1p2Ppp/2n5/bN3n1q/2B5/B4N2/P3QPPP/5RK1/w Nb5xPa7+ (Fine_WGCG) (page 38. Kolisch.) gnuchess seems to think the simple Pf7f8=Q, winding up 1 pawn up, is a good idea... Kolisch's move apparently forces quick victory, though.
