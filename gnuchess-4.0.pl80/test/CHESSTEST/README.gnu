To run all the Chess Test tests just type make. It will make the programs and 
start the testing. When I ran it it took approximately 75 hours to run.

The only configuration is to set the time per move in the script testall.
The last two arguments of testgen ate the #moves and the time in minutes.

On the Sun systems and the 486 running BSDI I experienced none of the hanging
problems reported on the SGI machines.
