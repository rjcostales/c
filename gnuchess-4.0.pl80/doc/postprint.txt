NAME
  postprint

SYNOPSIS
  ppoossttpprriinntt filename

DESCRIPTION
  _p_o_s_t_p_r_i_n_t creates a board by board postscript output file on stdout of the
  contents of the _g_n_u_c_h_e_s_s persistent hashfile.  The hashfile contains infor-
  mation from previous games saved by _g_n_u_c_h_e_s_s. For each position it prints
  the board, the best move for that position and the search depth that gen-
  erated the move as well as several flags indicating information about the
  position.  Flags show whether the score is a true score, or an upper or
  lower bound on the score and whether or not kingside or queenside castling
  was legal.  When combined with _C_h_e_s_s_F_o_n_t file and sent to a postscript
  printer it will show all boards in the range specified.  For each board the
  move and the current score are also printed.  CChheessssFFoonntt is courtesy of Andy
