6/19/91 dkb     Rearranged code segments to use small model.  This should
                speed up operation in win 3.0 (since far calls are slow).
                Recompiled with version 6.0ax of compiler.  Changed makefile
                so modules chess, search, eval, and initiali used /EM switch
                to enable global optimization.  Remove optimation from test.c
                to prevent optimizer from playing with test loop.

1/18/91 dkb     Revised abort look ahead logic.  User now enters can enter
                control C to abort bothsides (autoplay) mode.  Fixed search
                routine to properly handle the new translators.  Added F2
                command to enter moves with the keyboard.

                            on clocks to be Black and White.  Change menu
                            items save and list only to be active if there
                            has been any moves.  Added accelerator keys
                            for help (f1), and Undo/remove.  When not "easy"
                            accelerators are not active.
